# It's traditional way to calculate the diagonal sum.
## Time Complexity = O(n^2)

# Optimised Approach
## Time Complexity : O(n)


class Solution {
    public int diagonalSum(int[][] mat) {
        int n = mat.length;
        int sum =0;
        for(int i =0;i<n;i++)
        {   
            
            // Primary Diagonal where row == col
            sum = sum + mat[i][i];
            
            // Secondary Diagonal where row + col == sizeOfMatrix -1;
            sum = sum + mat[i][n-1-i];
        }
        
        
        // When n is odd then there would be one common element between
        // both diagonals , so it would be added twice ..... So in order         //  to remove it sum = sum - mat[n/2][n/2]
        
        sum = n%2 == 0 ? sum : sum - mat[n/2][n/2];
        
        return sum;
    }
